What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a place in which all the commits are kept after bring committed. This lets us start our version control program.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area nothing is committed but once it is committed, all of them get committed under one commit.
